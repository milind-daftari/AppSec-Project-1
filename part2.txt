hang.gft: This program goes into an infinite loop when arg1 = 253. This is because of the line pc += (char)arg1. In C, the type char is signed, meaning it can be either positive or negative. When arg1 is 253, casting it to a char type results in the value -3, which causes the program counter pc to decrement instead of increment. As a result, the pc continues to point to the same instruction, causing an infinite loop. This can be verified by checking the adresses in gdb. The input would be data += b'\x09\xfd' in the place of data += b'\x08' * 256 . Here, the hexadecimal xfd is 253 in decimal, and -3 in decimal from the signed 2's complement.
